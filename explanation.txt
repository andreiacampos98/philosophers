Differences between threads and processes

    Threads
        The threads are executing with the same memory /share memory
        The process id is the same
        All threads can access all the variables


    Processes
        The process are executing individually
        The process id is different
        We duplicate all the variables



Races conditions

    The threads are reading at same time the number
    This problem will be solving by mutex

Mutex
    It works like a lock
    phtread_mutex_t type of variable

    pthread_mutex_init() 
    pthread_mutex_destroy()
    pthread_mutex_lock()
    pthread_mutex_unlock()

    when I do a function which will be use for differents threads, 
    we need to use the pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock() 


Loops with threads

    Create an array of threads and then do a loop / while were we call the function pthread_create()
    We can't do a loop with the function pthread_create and pthread_join at the same time.
